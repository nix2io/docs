# Introduction

## Mission

Our mission is to allow normal people to connect their digital life together. Users will be able to connect all their online accounts, which we call integrations, and then can use an assortment of interfaces ranging from natrual langauge to web-based UI.

## The Platform

The platform is a set of services that abstracts the implemenation of certain functions so that developers can write software without needing to know how things work because the structure of data and behavior of functions are defined.

## Integrations

Integrations are what connect a 3rd party service to the platform standard. An interface does not need to know anything about the integration because all integrations have a defined structure.

## Interfaces

The mission of is to develop a platform that provides developers a structured way of interacting with data. This abstraction away from the implementation means that developers can create products that do not need to worry about the implementation, because they know how their data is to be structured.
