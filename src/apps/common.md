# Common Micro Front-end Architecture

This is the architecture used by all front-end applications on the Nix2 website.

## Framework

All applications are written in [Svelte.js](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) for its speed and small build size.

## Router

The router is still undecided but will list some options below:
- [Svelte Routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing) - A declarative Svelte routing library with SSR support. (1.4K‚≠ê)

## Communication

The default backend communication method is with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and therefore we are using an [Apollo client](https://github.com/timhall/svelte-apollo) for Svelte.
