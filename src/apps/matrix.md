# Matrix

The Matrix application is the interface for the [Matrix Service](../services/matrix.md), located at `/matrix`. This is intended to be used internally so there is a focus on utility and less on the design.

## Architecture

The Matrix front-end uses the same micro front-end architecture as all other applications. Read more on the [common front-end architecture](./common.md).

This is the design of the Matrix application.
